This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked mistake in Dockerfiles: using the `latest` tag for the base image, missing a working directory, and failing to clean up apt packages.  The `DockerfileBug.dockerfile` shows the problematic code, while `DockerfileBugSolution.dockerfile` provides the corrected version.  Using a specific version tag ensures reproducibility; setting a working directory ensures that your application files are in the correct location; and cleaning up apt packages reduces the image size.
